=========================

Small project to remember the check list of steps for neural networks


### Stochastic Gradient Descent



- [ ] Normalize/scale inputs. _Ref: [#1][2]_
- [ ] Initialize the weights in a good (random) way. _Ref: [#1][2]_
- [ ] Randomly shuffle the training examples. _Ref: [#1][2]_
- [ ] Experiment with the learning rates using a small sample of the training set _Ref: [#1][1]_
- [ ] During the training phase, check if you suffer from high bias or high variance. Overfit?.
